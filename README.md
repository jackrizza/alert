#alert
This repository was created for testing and learning purposes. If you have any means in using it in your own applications then please do! I would love to hear if you do use any of my code as well.
<br />
Our main goal is to :
  * create alerts that work both on mobile and desktop
  * load via ajax
  * server back-end node.js and mongodb
<br />
